## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned so much, creating this Four cards challenge using Grid layout and flexbox too, but I preferred Gridbox. 

The code snippets:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of this challenge is?</h1>
<p class="proud-of-this-css">Semantic Html(A11y)</p>
<h2>Some CSS code I'm proud of this challenge is?</h2>
<p class="proud-of-this-css">Grid and flexbox layout</p><span>how to use it.</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```


### Continued development

I am continuing to develop additional challenges in FEM to improve my learning skills and gain a better understanding, particularly regarding the practical applications of Gridbox and Flexbox, including how and when to utilize them.



### Useful resources

 Here are some excellent resources for learning more about Flexbox if you haven’t had much experience with it yet:

- [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/) - Wes Bos has created a brilliant free course to teach Flexbox box fundamentals.
- [An Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - Josh Comeau's  helped me for when and how to use flexbox layout. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - When you think you know your stuff, Flexbox Froggy is a fun game that tests your knowledge.
- [MDN: Basic concepts of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - This is another handy resource for getting you comfortable with Flexbox's basic concepts and features.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - When you think you know your stuff, Flexbox Froggy is a fun game that tests your knowledge.


### Useful resources

As with the Flexbox resources above, there are some excellent free CSS Grid learning resources out there:

- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) - This free course by Wes Bos, in partnership with Mozilla Firefox, teaches you all about CSS Grid.
- [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - Josh Comeau's  is an amazing article which helped me  understand how to use gridbox layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [MDN: Basic concepts of grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - This MDN run-through provides an excellent overview of CSS Grid and gets you up and running with the fundamentals.
- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/) - Rachel Andrew has created an extremely comprehensive CSS Grid resource. It includes examples, patterns, and tutorials and is a great resource to bookmark and refer to repeatedly.
- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - Similar to Flexbox Froggy, this game is fun to test your CSS Grid knowledge before diving into realistic projects.
